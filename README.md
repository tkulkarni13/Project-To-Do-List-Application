# To-Do List Application

This app provides users with the ability to create a to-do list for themselves. Using the command line, users can add, view, mark as complete, or delete tasks. In order to run the application, you can save the python file, and run it from the command line. The program will then prompt additional steps from that point, about building a to-do list.
